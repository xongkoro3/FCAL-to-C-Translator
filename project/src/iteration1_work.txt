Division of Labor Statement

My partner and I split up the work with the aim of learning together. Therefore we both made contributions to the project. 
- We pair-programmed and wrote scanner.cpp as well as scanner.h together, and contributed an equal amount of work on those 2 files.
- Chau wrote the test cases in scanner_tests.h.

Division of Labor Statement
Shuai He & Chau Nguyen

My partner and I split up the work with the aim of learning together. Therefore we both made contributions to the project. 
- We modified scanner.cpp and scanner.h together. We spent equal amount of efforts on working the files. Debugging on the scan function of scanner.cpp is mainly done by Chau.
- mysample.dsl is done by Shuai and we spent eqaul amount of time on updating the Makefile.
